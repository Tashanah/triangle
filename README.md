## Description
{This app helps people figure out types of triangles based on the data they enter (length of each side). }
## Setup/Installation Requirements

{This app does not require any special software to run.
  The following is a list of the behavior driven requirements for determining type of triangle.
  1) For an equilateral triangle, all sides must be equal.
2)For an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.
3)For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.
4)Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values. (For example, the values 9,4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.}
